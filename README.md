pluralsight_d3_course
=====================

This project is an application/directory of all the
pluralsight d3 tutorial videos (With some modification of mine).
Since the source code is not currently published,
and there is some guesswork and inaccuracies in some of the videos, 
the correct, completely functional solutions are presented here.
